              <h1><b>Meng Shan Li</b></h1>
              <p>My name is Meng Shan Li.“Strength does not come from physical
                capacity.It comes from an indomitable will,’’ is my motto.
                I was born on July 27.2000, in New Taipei City,Taiwan. My father is a
                civil servant. My mother is a civil servant, too. I have two sisters. We
                enjoy a very happy family life.
                Since I was a little girl, I have been interested in painting. That is the
                reason why I entered National Taichung University of Science and
                Technology and majored in Multimedia Design. During school days, I
                studied hard for all my lessons and learned—INTRODUCTION OF
                COMPUTER SCIENCE, PHOTOGRAPHY, PAINTING, HISTORY OF
                DESIGN and so on. As to my professional skills, I am good at operating
                computer(Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign…).
                I am friendly, quiet and shy. I like to draw and sing. In the future, it will
                be my pleasure if I can get a job from an animation company in the
                future.</p>

              <h1><b>Ya-Jie,Zhang</b></h1>
              <p>Fri,24th Dec 1999, at 21:30 p.m., I was born in Taoyuan.
                I live with my parents and younger sister as a family of four
                Because my mother is a church administrator, I grew up in the church.
                Until I was 18 years old, I left my hometown and came to Taichung for college.
                I am major in multimedia design at National Taichung University of Science and Technology.
                In fact, when I was in junior high school just major in multimedia design.
                So I'm good at photography,video editing, music editing, sound mixing and graphic design and a little 3d
                modeling.
                I like play piano and guitar in my spare time. Playing music what I like by my hands make me feel
                satisfied and relax. Sometimes, I feel sad, I will play piano to express my emotions, too.
                When it comes to my dreams,it's probably going to buy a superbike and travel around.
                By the way, I'm also a cataholic but have no money to raise a cat.

              <p>My name is Lau Ching Lam, Cobie. I was born on 31st January, 1999 in Hong Kong. My dad worked as a
                restaurant manager for Hotel Nikko before. Now he is operating a beverage shop with my mum. My sister is
                a junior high school student.
                I studied in Hong Kong until I immigrated to TaiWan with my family in 2015. We decided to settle down in
                KaohSiung, so I studied in Chung-Hwa School of Arts. My major is Fashion Craft which learns different
                skills of handcraft, such as pottery, metalwork, woodwork etc.
                When I was small, I was interested in drawing. I drew in my free time, and I hoped I could create my own
                character by myself. Therefore, I am a Multimedia Design major at National TaiChung University of
                Science and Technology now. I work hard on how to model, rig, animate 3D characters, also in 2D, create
                3d scenes with PBR texture, make a microfilm and motion graphic etc. I am good at related software, such
                as Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effect, Maya, Substance and so on.
                I worked for a photographic studio for 2 years when I was a freshman in university. I learned photo
                toning, headshots photography, developing photos, serving the customers and getting along with my
                colleagues through my job which could help me a lot in the future.

              <p>My name is TSENG,CHEN-YAO born in Yilan, and living in Nanfangao There is a fishing village. From the
                door, you can see the port full of fishing boats. I live with my grandparents, parents, and sisters. My
                parents didn’t have a childhood because they were curious about how computer games were caused, so they
                came to study the information department of Luodong High Engineering, and they were exposed to Labview,
                VB, App Inventor, etc. And they could do some simple games, but they still couldn’t go deeper. Learn to
                make a good game.
                Interests and expertise:
                My hobbies are ball sports, watching live events, reading novels, and playing games. Sometimes I’m bored
                and I try to draw and paint things I see. I know I am not as good as a professional painter, but when I
                paint, I feel at ease, as if the pressure of class has been released. Although several other interests
                can also relieve pressure, only drawing is completely from scratch and created by myself, so I also want
                to use the relevant programs I have learned to try to make a game by myself, not just Confined to the
                side of the game.
